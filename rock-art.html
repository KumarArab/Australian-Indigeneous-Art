									<p>Rock art, including painting and engraving or carving (petroglyphs), can be found at sites throughout Australia. Examples of rock art have been found that are believed to depict extinct megafauna such as Genyornis[4] and Thylacoleo in the Pleistocene era[5] as well as more recent historical events such as the arrival of European ships.</p>
									<p>The oldest examples of rock art, in Western Australia's Pilbara region and the Olary district of South Australia, are estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old.[7] The oldest firmly dated rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal drawing on a rock fragment found during the excavation of the Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter in south-western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Dated at 28,000 years, it is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth with a confirmed date.</p>
									<p>Gwion Gwion rock art (the "Bradshaw rock paintings", also referred to as Giro Giro"[3]), initially named after Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891, consists of a series of rock paintings on caves in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.[8] A 2020 study puts this art at about 12,000 years old.</p>
                                    <p>The Maliwawa Figures were documented in a study led by Paul Taçon and published in Australian Archaeology in September 2020.[11] The art includes 572 images across 87 sites in northwest Arnhem Land, from Awunbarna (Mount Borradaile[12]) area across to the Wellington Range. They are estimated to have been drawn between 6,000 and 9,400 years ago.[13] The find is described as very rare, not only in style, but in their depiction of bilbies (not known historically in Arnhem Land)[14] and the first known depiction of a dugong.[15] The art, all paintings in red to mulberry colour apart from one drawing, and in a naturalistic style, had not been described in the literature before this study. They are large, and depict relationships between people and animals, a rare theme in rock art. Bilbies, thylacines and dugong have been extinct in Arnhem land for millennia. The art was first seen by the 2008-2009 researchers, but were only studied in field research lasting from 2016 to 2018. The figures were named by Ronald Lamilami, a senior Traditional Owner.[12][16] According to Tacon, "The Maliwawa back-to-back figures are the oldest known for western Arnhem Land and it appears this painting convention began with the Maliwawa style. It continues to the present with bark paintings and paintings on paper".[17] Taçon draws comparisons between the Maliwawa Figures and George Chaloupka's Dynamic Figures style, where the subject matter consists of about 89 percent humans, compared with 42% of the Maliwawa Figures.[18] There is, however, much complexity and debate regarding the classification of rock art style in Arnhem Land.</p>
                                    <p>Other painted rock art sites include Laura, Queensland,[20] Ubirr, in the Kakadu National Park,[21] Uluru,[22] and Carnarvon Gorge. Rock engraving, or petroglyphs, are created by methods which vary depending on the type of rock being used and other factors. There are several different types of rock art across Australia, the most famous of which is Murujuga in Western Australia, the Sydney rock engravings around Sydney in New South Wales, and the Panaramitee rock art in Central Australia. The Toowoomba engravings, depicting carved animals and humans, have their own peculiar style not found elsewhere in Australia.</p>

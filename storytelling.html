										<h2>Storytelling in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Speaking is the primary form of communication in Aboriginal cultures and Torres Strait Islander cultures. Concepts and beliefs have been passed on from generation to generation through specific cultural practices, traditions, languages, laws and family relationships. The oral traditions of instruction include storytelling, song, dance, and art- and craft-making.</p>
                                    <p>Important communications and histories have been carried across history via various mediums such as message sticks, rock and sand art, body painting, song, dance and carvings. Nowadays, more contemporary histories and events are often expressed through the visual and performing arts, songs, multimedia and literary expositions including prose, poetry, plays and other scriptwriting.</p>
                                    <p>Though there are many different types of stories they fall into four broad categories: collective histories, spiritual narratives, cultural practices and life histories. There are also some stories by Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples that do not fit into any of these categories, such as fiction stories.</p>
                                    <p>Below are some examples of various types of stories and the mediums used to tell them.</p>

												<h3>K’gari</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The digital story of K’gari gives two perspectives about what happened when Eliza Fraser was shipwrecked on K’gari (Fraser Island), which is the Country of the Butchella peoples. It invites viewers to ‘help destroy one of Australia’s first fake news stories’, and this is incorporated into interactive elements of the story. Using spoken and written words, images and music, the drama raises questions about perceptions, history-making and truth-telling. At the end of the tale there is a link to PDF teacher notes.</p>
